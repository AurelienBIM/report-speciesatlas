# Foreword {-}

This report was written during my 3 month internship in the association *EtcTerra*. This internship was part of my fourth year of taking engineer classes at *INSA Lyon*. If the subject of my internship was only to work on Madagascar's biodiversity, it changed a little as I was working in Montpellier. The result of my work finally is a R package compatible with every given area called *speciesatlas*. More informations about *EtcTerra* and the whole *BioSceneMada* project can be found at the end of the report in the Annex section.
