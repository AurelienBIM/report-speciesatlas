    Abstract                 = {Deforestation and forest degradation have been occurring for thousands of years. Both are important sources of global warming pollution, as well as threats to biodiversity and the livelihoods of forest peoples. Thus it is important to understand the causes of these changes—the “drivers” of deforestation. In this report we focus on the economic agents that currently play a critical role in deforestation, as well as agents that have played a historical role in deforestation (to determine their role today). },
