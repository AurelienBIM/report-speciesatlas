The production of a biodiversity atlas is part of the *BioSceneMada project* [@Vieilledent2018], led by both the *CIRAD* and *EtcTerra*. This project started in 2014 and leads many actions and researchs on Madagascar's biodiversity (Fig. \@ref(fig:des)). This project was made to evaluate the loss of biodiversity that would be brought by various causes. Among them, there are demographic growth, deforestation or climate change. The project offers to study both their separate and united effects. The final aim is to identify high priority areas for biodiversity conservation in order to design a more effective protected area network in Madagascar.

*EtcTerra* is the association where i am doing my internship. Most of its employees comes from the Yann Arthus-Bertrand's *GoodPlanet* Foundation. They were part of the *Carbon Action* programme, and in 2012 they created their own association in full collaboration with *GoodPlanet*. They are engaged in several countries of Africa, such as Madagascar, Mozambique, Mali, Ivory Coast ... The main mission of *EtcTerra* is to lead projects that preserve the environment while contributing to the local economy. Their action plan has 3 main themes :

-- *Agriculture, Forestry and Land-Use* : conciliate economic and environmental sustainability, capacity of production responding to the increasing demand and food security.

-- *Integrated Water Resource Management* : prevent the water use conflict coming with demographic growth, ensure water security and anticipate the effects of the global warming.

-- *Access to Energy and Waste Recycling* : produce energy that will be available for every locals, improvice the garbages' management in urban area.

In the december of 2017, *EtcTerra* and *Rongead* merged to become *Nitidae*. *Rongead* was an assocation created in 1983 and based in Lyon. They leaded projects in Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Tchad, Tanzanie and other african countries more occasionally. Therefore the new association *Nitidae* gathers 60 people (living in France or expatriate) and keeps leading the projects of *EtcTerra* and *Rongead*.
