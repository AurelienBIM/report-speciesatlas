["introduction.html", "1. Introduction Context Gap Knowledge What do we propose ?", " 1. Introduction Context Biodiversity management is a crucial issue for the upcoming years. It is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenge of the century, and the necessity for mankind to protect it is real. Huge responsabilities lies on the shoulders of those who have to lead it, such as ministries or site managers. Managing the biodiversity stands on several actions. For example, it involves characterisation, quantization, identification, location, … But maybe the most important aspect of biodiversity management is preservation. According to the IUCN (http://www.iucnredlist.org/), more and more species are getting the endangered status every year although there are means invested to prevent it. Among these species, the vegetal ones are heavily affected by the deforestation. The most known example is oil palm and all the cuts that its exploitation brings mainly in Southeast Asian countries (Boucher et al. 2011). This oil is the world cheapest edible and is present in a significant amount of products, this is why the need for it is growing so strong regardless of the havoc it’s causing. Some tree species also are threatened by local farmers that are turning parts of forest into fields to respond to their agricultural needs (Brondizio et al. 2009). Species of great mammals like elephants or rhinos are jeopardized by poaching, notably on the African continent. These illegal hunts target either their meat or the ivory of their tusks. In most cases, individuals of these species unfortunately are very scarce, this is why it is a priority to preserve them. Some species are not as popularized to the general public as pandas or koalas are but they sure aren’t less important. For example, bees and others pollinator insects are literally vital to biodiversity, and they are in particular endangered by the overuse of chimical products on plants (Isenring 2010). Generally speaking, most of the species will be or already are threatened by climate changes. Due to global warming, many of them are losing their natural habitat. To face this danger, these species are led up to move to another suitable place or to adapt themselves. All the reasons developed above lead to the disparition of whole ecosystem services, which is dramatic. These are the benefits that humans gain from properly-functioning ecosystems, with the example of the pollination that was discussed earlier. Gap Knowledge Site managers need some tools to ensure preservation in best possible ways. In the first place, they obviously require some species occurrences data. These are gathered by collectors that work on the spot. It’s a long and meticulous task that demands a lot of expertise. But these sole pieces of information are difficult to exploit in itself. They become way more comprehensible when synthesize as distribution maps or index of vulnerability to climate change. To obtain these documents, there are already some packages available on CRAN, the network where you can download and install any kind of R packages. For example, there is the package BIOMOD2 (Thuiller et al. 2016). This is a package designed to understand the relationship between species and their environment, offering several different models to run. Depending on some given variables, distribution datas are produced, for the present and for the future alike. As well as some package of the same kind (SDM (Naimi &amp; Araujo 2016), hSDM (Vieilledent et al. 2014)), BIOMOD2 produces some strong results but the main drawback is that it isn’t easily accessible. Using the functions of the package requires a really good understanding of all the parameters asked, and there is quite a lot of them. Altogether, these packages are great tools but aren’t very user friendly. On the other extreme, there is the MaxEnt software, that stands for Maximum Entropy. It is equipped with a Java interface, which clearly is more approachable when you’re not an expert in this sector. On the down side, this method is limited to consider only one model, the one proposed by MaxEnt. This way, the uncertainty isn’t taken in consideration. Besides, the synthesis of the results isn’t really optimized. With these examples, we see that there already are interesting tools for those who manage biodiversity preservation but there are still some progress to be made. What do we propose ? We saw that the task of managing a site and focusing on some areas rather than others is a decisive work. It demands both computing and statistical skills, in addition to time. People in charge don’t necessarily have those, and this is why the development of the speciesatlas R package started. Its main goal is to fill in the gaps left by the other packages, by offering some reliable methods and an accessible interface for the wide public. On the technical part, speciesatlas uses 5 of the models from BIOMOD2 that were chosen because of their complementarity. These models are obviously taking the uncertainty in consideration. For each species given, present and future distribution maps are produced, as well as the ecological niche. The importance of the input variables is also estimated. An important motive of the package is also to be quite illustrative. This is why taxonomy, image and description text are provided besides of the previous documents. All of these are gathered in a synthetic sheet. The rendering is automated in the form of a Web page or a PDF document. The choice of the output format is left to the user. One interessant feature is that the calculus can be parallelized when there is a huge amount of data to process. If the computing device has several cores, spreading the task between them will reduce the running time significantly. Finally, the rendering is totally dynamic. That means that the database can be changed as many time as wanted. References "],
["method.html", "2. Method Datas Models Effectiveness indicators Structure of the code Creation of a R package Tools for the presentation", " 2. Method Datas To use the package, it is essential to provide a database relative to the species and the place to be studied. This database only needs to specify the name of the specie, the latitude and the longitude of the observation and the taxon group. The datas must be splitted into the different taxons in presence, like in the example below. The package is functioning with the concept of pseudo-absence (Barbet-Massin et al. 2012). It means that species are not necessarily considered missing of pixels where there isn’t any observation of it. A small probability of their presence is taken in consideration. This method proved its reliability against simply considering the specie absent when there is no presence. df.orig # Input data must be this form [[1]] [[1]]$Species [1] Eulemur fulvus Allocebus trichotis Avahi laniger [4] Hapalemur griseus 4 Levels: Allocebus trichotis Avahi laniger … Hapalemur griseus [[1]]$Lat [1] -19.70000 -14.32861 -21.18300 -18.74623 [[1]]$Long [1] 47.80000 48.58611 48.33400 48.75815 [[1]]$Taxo.group [1] “lemurs” [[2]] [[2]]$Species [1] Adansonia digitata Adansonia madagascariensis [3] Adansonia grandidieri Adansonia rubrostipa 4 Levels: Adansonia digitata … Adansonia rubrostipa [[2]]$Lat [1] -16.03030 -12.95461 -20.87564 -14.74680 [[2]]$Long [1] 45.57406 49.12567 44.10619 47.37811 [[2]]$Taxo.group [1] “baobabs” In addition to this list of dataframes, the package needs environmental and climatic datas about the place of interest. These can be passed in a .TIF file containing a raster for every variable of the study. Since the package offers distribution predictions for both present and future, several rasterstacks are involved . A contemporary one is enough but some future’s are needed. The package require a rasterstack for every different representative concentration pathways (RCP), global climate models (GCM) and year of prediction. environ # This is an exemple of rasterstack for the present. class : RasterStack dimensions : 1528, 803, 1226984, 5 (nrow, ncol, ncell, nlayers) resolution : 1000, 1000 (x, y) extent : 298000, 1101000, 7155000, 8683000 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) coord. ref. : +proj=utm +zone=38 +south +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 names : temp, tseas, prec, cwd, alt min values : 113, 848, 331, 0, -8 max values : 276, 3337, 3373, 973, 2797 Models Under a certain number of individuals for a given species, it is quite absurd to run models on it. It may theoretically make the calculus but the results would have no sense. After some experimentations, we decided to set this number to 10. It indeed removes a lot of species but we could have not make any interpretation on them. The package uses BIOMOD2 for the technical part. It only takes its advantage and not its default, because the parameters are already set in speciesatlas. Each model returns a binary response for a presence at a specific location, and that is why having several models is so important to predict presence probability. The model averaging is quite simple, it was decided that if 3 models on 5 indicate a presence, we could consider it as well. We chose those 5 models of BIOMOD2 : – Generalized Linear Model (GLM) : it is an adaptable generalization of the linear regression. It allows to connect the linear model to the response variable with a link function. That function is logit in the package. That model is very general and can suit to most of the cases. – Generalized Additive Model (GAM) (Jones &amp; Almond 1992) : it is close to a GLM but it benefits the properties of additive models. The linear relationship between the response and predictor variables is replaced by non-linear smooths functions. GAM can suit other cases than GLM, notably the ones where there’s few observations. – Random Forest (RF) : it is a supervised classification algorithm that creates plenty of decision trees. It is training on some of the data to classify the other. Thanks to the random process of the nodes, there is no overfit if there’s enough trees. That is the main advantage of this model. – Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) : based on the number of individuals and the total energy, relative abundance distribution is predicted. Maximizing the entropy is the way to discriminate the different possibilities. The version used in the package is MaxEnt.Phillips. – Artificial Neural Network (ANN) : this model is inspired from brains’ neural network, it means that it is learning task after task. It’s interesting to have this model in the package because of its complementarity with the others. Eventually, we have a parametric model (GLM) that is very constrained, a non-parametric model (GAM) and 3 others machine learning models. All of them have pro and cons, like overparametrization but we think that this set of models offers a good complementarity and can adapt to the large diverstity of the data input. Effectiveness indicators Predicted / Observed Presence Absence Total Presence \\(n_{11}\\) \\(n_{01}\\) \\(n_{.1}\\) Absence \\(n_{10}\\) \\(n_{00}\\) \\(n_{.0}\\) Total \\(n_{1.}\\) \\(n_{0.}\\) n To verify the truthfulness of the models’ calculus, other functionalities of BIOMOD2 can be used. The function Find.Optim.Stat offers several effectiveness indicators (Thuiller et al. 2010) than help to evaluate the results. Some of the effectiveness indicators relies on the exploitation of the confusion matrix (Liu, White &amp; Newell 2010). We say that they are threshold-dependent because they need binary variables. Therefore the threshold is the most important parameter in those cases. The confusion matrix is a table that confronts the predicted and the observed results, and there is an example above. For every indicator, the goal is to be as close as possible to 1 or 100%. We chose the following ones : – Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) : it is a threshold-independent indicator.That means that the values don’t need to be binarized, it works on continuous prediction. It evaluates the models using the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC). It’s one of the index the most used in statistic, and also in Species Distribution Modelling (SDM). – Accuracy (OA) : it is threshold-dependent, and evaluates how many cases had been correctly classify with the following equation : \\(OA = (n_{11} + n_{00})/n\\) – True Skill Statistic (TSS) : depends a lot on Sensitivity and Specificity because its formula is : \\(TSS = Sen. + Spe. - 1\\). It is defined as the average of the net prediction success rate for both presence and absence sites. – KAPPA (K) : this is a way to “normalize” the accuracy, to take in consideration the relative part of its results. Accuracy tends to overestimate the values. It’s calculated with : \\(K = (OA-A)/(1-A)\\) where \\(A=(n_{11}*n_{11}+n_{01}*n_{10})/n^{2}\\) – Sensitivity (Sen.) : probability of making a right prediction on the presence of a species (true positive). It’s calculated with : \\(Sen. = n_{11}/n_{1.}\\) – Specificity (Spe.) : probability of making a right prediction on the absence of a species (true negative). It’s calculated with : \\(Sen. = n_{11}/n_{1.}\\) Structure of the code After talking about the substance of the package by studying its technical part, time has come to discuss the form of it. First, the decision to make a package quickly became evident. We wanted to have a practical and shareable tool, and the medium of the package maybe is the best for that. To do that, we used the R library Devtools(Wickham, Hester &amp; Chang 2018), which is really helpful to create packages and to share them. For clarity reasons, the R code was separated between different scripts. That makes it easier to modify only a small section of the package, and its architecture gets clearer either. The different scripts of the package are : – speciesatlas.R : the main script of the package, containing the fun.main function. It calls fun.data and it handles the parallelization of the calculus between the different cores of the device. – fun.data.R : rearrange the datas into SpatialPointsDataFrame. It order to name files, it creates a vector with proper species names (points instead of spaces). – fun.species.R : the function fun.species is called for every species. It figures out if there’s enough complete observations to run the models. Afterthat it calls the fun.extent function and eventually the functions fun.models, fun.plot and fun.taxo are called. – fun.extent.R : determines if a zoom could be useful, in case there’s few individuals of the species of if they are very gathered. – fun.models.R : runs all the models for a given species. If the parameter run.models is set on FALSE, it just loads the files. – fun.plot.R : If run.plot is set on TRUE, the different maps are generated. – fun.taxo.R : If run.taxo is set on TRUE, taxonomy, descriptive image and text are collected on Encyclopedia of Life. – fun.book.R : Produces the Bookdown output. – fun.pdf.R : Produces the PDF output. – fun.map.R : Produces the specific richness maps, global and for every taxon. Creation of a R package Creating a R package was actually a brand new thing for me. The structure of the package is visible on Fig. 2. A lot of online tutorials helped me to achieve this task, but the main library that I used was Devtools. The first step for the creation is the command devtools::create(&quot;package.name&quot;) : it creates the basic architecture of the package, also called the skeleton. The following files are automatically generated : – a DESCRIPTION file : informations like authors, version, license and libraries to import are in it. – a NAMESPACE file : here are established functions that can be run by the user and functions from libraries that will be used in the package. – a .gitignore file : you indicate if there are files (test scripts or development notes) that you don’t want to be in the final package. – a R/ folder : all the R scripts that constitute the package must be put here. – a inst/ folder : if the package needs other files than R scripts like images or R markdown files, they must be put in this folder. If a file is not in this folder, it won’t be retained during the installation of the package. – a man/ folder : Here are stored the manual files, coded in Markdown. They are explaining the different functions and the package in general. It is what you see when you type ?speciesatlas or help(speciesatlas). Figure 2: Structure of the speciesatlas package. Tools for the presentation In the case of the speciesatlas package, we needed to include .Rnw and .Rmd files, but it’s impossible to place them in the R/ folder. The tip is to put all these non-R files in a inst/ folder: actually every file in this folder will remain untouched while the installation of the package. It is later possible to access these files with the R command system.file. Afterthat, it is important to add a README.md file and a man/ folder containing a .md file for every function accessible for the user. The README.md file must present the package and explain how to use it : it is the front page on the Github repository. The .md files explain in details the arguments needed by the function and its output. library(devtools) devtools::install_github(&quot;AurelienBIM/speciesatlas&quot;) library(speciesatlas) It only is with those few lines of R code that the package can be downloaded and installed. When the package is ran, the output can take 2 different forms. It’s the user’s job to specify which one he wants. Thanks to some files coded in Sweave and the knitr package (Xie 2014), there can be a PDF output. We also added a Bookdown (Xie 2016) output : this is a package using the R Markdown language to create interactive books. It produce multiple HTML pages and can easily be turned in a website.

Results Context of our tests In this project, the area on which we tested the package was the whole island of Madagascar. We chose this area to be in accordance with the project but the package is fully adaptable to other places. Madagascar is very interesting to study in this context because of its rich and abundant biodiversity. Not only there is many species of animals or vegetation but a lot of these are endemic to the isle. Among all the country we could have the necessary data, Madagascar may be the best example. The datas used in the project come from the REBIOMA (http://www.rebioma.net/) project that collected a lot of observations of the biodiversity in the whole island of Madagascar. Two of the dataset used in the tests are coming from there : one for baobabs and one for lemurs. To push the tests a little further, we also added data for birds coming from eBird and reptiles from Cirad. In the end we tested the package on hundreds of species (8 of boababs, 71 of lemurs, 283 of birds and hundreds of reptiles). To run the models, we need climatic and environmental variables. Our datas are coming from MadaClim (https://madaclim.cirad.fr/). This site is a product of the Bioscenemada project that gather the information of WorldClim relative to Madagascar. The data is stored as .tif file and contains layers for the different studied variables, with a 1km precision all over the island. There are current datas (based on observation from 1950 to 2000) but also several future datas, one for every scenario we choose. The choice of the variables to run the models on is crucial because the results rely directly on it. We were looking for variables that were the least correlate but though the most complete. One important point to choose these ones (Fig. 3) was that they are easily interpretable. – Annual Mean Temperature (temp) – Temperature Seasonability (tseas) : quantify the variation of the temperature over the seasons. The lowest it is, the least temperature’s change there is. – Annual Precipitation (prec) – Annual Climatic Water Deficit (cwd) : for a given month, if there is less precipitation than evapotranspiration (pet), we can say that there is a climatic water deficit. This number is calculated with the following equation : \\(cwd=-\\sum_{i} min(prec_{i} - pet_{i},0)\\), where \\(i\\) takes the value of the twelve months of the year. – Altitude (alt) Figure 3: The variables we chose for our study. Afterthat we had to choose which future scenarios to study. It was important to have several predictions but not too much either otherwise the calculus time would have been very high. Here are the scenarios we favoured (Vieilledent et al. 2016) : – for Representative Concentration Pathways. RCPs are 4 scenarios that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) adopted for its fifth Assessment Report (AR5). There is RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6 and RCP8.5. THe numbers in the RCPs’ names are greenhouse gas concentration expressed in W/m2, it stands for the trajectory of the planet’s warming. We chose RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, two RCPs that are giving a good overview without burdening too much the time of running. RCP4.5 means that the emmission peak would be around 2040 and afterthat it would decline. RCP8.5 considers that emmissions will keep rising for the whole century. – for Global Climate Models(Stute, Clement &amp; Lohmann 2001). A GCMs depicts the physical processes that happen at any level of the Earth (land surface, ocean, atmosphere or above …). Based on the Navier Stokes equations, they are often used for weather forecasting. We chose Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) (Gent et al. 2011), Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E version 2 with Russell ocean model (GISS-E2-R) (Nazarenko et al. 2013) and Hadley Global Environment Model 2 - Earth System (HadGEM2-ES) (Office 2016). – for years. We decided to choose 2050 and 2080. Content of an atlas page Figure 4: Example of the top of a page. Now we’re gonna describe the different items that constitute an atlas page. As said before the output can be HTML or PDF but the content is strictly the same for both of the mediums. On top of the page (Fig. 4) there is the name of the species, its taxonomy with the kingdom and the family. When available there’s also the authority (name and year) and the IUCN status. It is an endangerment indicator for every species, with different levels of threat like Least Concern (LC), Vulnerable (VU) or Critically Endangered (CR). Below these, there are descriptive image and text (when available) that helps to know which species it is about if its name is not evocative enough. A link to the corresponding Encyclopedia of Life page is given for every species. The first map on the top left (Fig. 5) is showing all the occurences of the species with the map of the area for background. The number of occurences for the species is written on the right of the maps. Every species have those items in common, but the presence of the other informations depend on the number of occurences for the species. We saw that earlier, we chose not to run the models if the species presented less than 10 observations. For those species, there isn’t anything else on the atlas page. For other species with enough inidividuals, the results of the models are presented over several maps and tables. The second map (Fig. 6) is showing the binary vote for every model concerning the presence of the species. If 3 models or more are considering the presence on a pixel, we admit the species is present there, and it is colored in green on the map. The sum of these presences gives us the Species distribution area, which is the predicted number of km2 with at least one presence of the species. Also there is a table (Tab. 1) that shows the values for the effectiveness indicators that were presented earlier. On the following section, the graph on the left (Fig. 7) is presenting the relation between Annual precipitation and Mean annual temperature : every species is marked by a dot at the intersection of its value for the two variables. It allows us to see if the species only live under certain conditions. For most of the species, those climatic niches are relatively gathered. On the right of this section, there’s firstly a table (Tab. 2) that informs us on the environmental tendancy for places where individuals of the species where detected. There are the mean and quantiles for every variable studied, it gives an idea on the environment this species need. The second table (Tab. 3) gives information on the importance of the climatic variables. In other words it designates which are the variables that are conditioning the most the presence of the species. We can read the results for every 5 models of BIOMOD2, and there’s a synthesis on the two last columns. The last section of the page is presenting the results obtained for the different future scenarios. The two maps on the left (Fig. 8, 9) are the extreme cases (RCP8.5 and 2080) with or without dispersion. There’s 15 levels on the legend because of the 5 models and the 3 GCMs. For every GCM we have the binary response for every distribution model. That time we consider the species present on a pixel if at least 8 out of 15 answers are positive. Summing these pixels provides us the new Species distribution area for this scenario, and we can measure the percentage of variation relative to the projections for the present. Those informations are in the two last columns of the table (Tab. 4). Table 1: Example of the table presenting the effectiveness indicators.

Figure 9: Example of the map for the extreme scenario without dispersion. Exploitation of the results A prototype of the atlas is available at http://etclab.org/atlas. It was made with some species of the 4 taxons we run the models on, and it offers a good overview of the functionning of the atlas. With the projections of distribution that BIOMOD2 is producing, it is possible to make some maps of specific richness by taxon. On the Fig. 10, 11, 12 and 13, the different figures are standing for : (a) current, (b) 45 and 2050, (c) 45 and 2080, (d) 85 and 2050 and (e) 85 and 2080. These maps help to identify the hotspots of species’ preservation. Comparing the current maps to the future ones gives a good indication on the species that are threatened. The most obvious example is the one of the lemurs : we can see that presently they’re living in the humid forests, east of Madagascar. In every future scenarios, the presence of the species invariably decreases, the last welcoming places for the lemurs being the heights of the mountains. Figure 10: Specific richness for the lemurs.

["discussion.html", "4. Discussion Applications Limitations Perspectives", " 4. Discussion Applications The speciesatlas package is useful for various reasons. It is a tool designed for site’s managers to help them doing their job. The package allows to work with thousands of different species with a single launch, the only limit is the calculation time. In the atlas, the species can be gathered by taxon, or by any category wanted : it just depends on the input data. Finally, there is one synthetic page presenting the results of the models for every species, in the most clear and accessible way. The datas needed to use the package are not that complicated to obtain. Both species’ occurences and climatic datas of the place to study can be found in free access, for example with WorldClim and GBIF (https://www.gbif.org/). The datas might need a little upstream work but that’s still very accessible. As we saw earlier the files generated by BIOMOD2 can be used to create specific richness maps, or several kind of biodiversity indicators, this is what we call \\(\\alpha\\)-diversity. These documents are a really good synthesis of all the informations obtained, they allow to identify the biodiversity hot-spots. Site’s managers can rely on those maps to establish their action plan concerning species’ preservation. They know which are the most threatened places so they can focus their strength on protecting those from deforestation or illegal poaching. Limitations There obvisouly are some limitations to the package. To make it more user friendly we decided to set the parameters of BIOMOD2 to particular values and that makes speciesatlas less adaptable than BIOMOD2. This could have been great to vary the parameters depending on the species currently studied. The choice of the models itself could be changeable between different species, for example we saw that ANN gave better results for some species but less significant for others. Also we could be able to indicate different climatic or environmental variables according to the species : not all species are affected by the same variables. Concerning the variables, we only use climatic ones in our tests, it would be interesting to add more environmental ones like the forest cover. These environmental variables aren’t necessarly related to the climatic ones so the results would be even more reliable if they were taken in consideration. Another limitation of the package is the calculation time. Even with a good computing machine, it may take a long time to run the package. The parallelization of the calculus makes it viable otherwise it would really last too many time. In average, the models take 45 minutes for every species. We see that it is essential to have several cores on the computer. Perspectives Because it still is in its early stages of development, there are some features that could be add to speciesatlas. A major step forward would be to consider the \\(\\beta\\)-diversity. It involves leading the studies by community of species and not only by individual species. A solid interaction between 2 species won’t be considered only using \\(\\alpha\\)-diversity, although it may explain the produced results. That would also allow us to produce lists of present species in a given area, which can be very useful. To face the issue of the calcutation time, online servers could be the solution. Many organisms are offering virtual machines where you can run calculus on. The architecture the most optimised for the use of the package would be the one depicted on (Fig. 14). The fact of having little machines with couples of cores would improve the computing time because the functions of BIOMOD2 can also be parallelized. For the moment we are not taking advantage of this feature by only parallelizing between each species. Figure 14: The optimised architecture of a virtual machine to run the package. "],
